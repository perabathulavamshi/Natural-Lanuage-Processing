# Natural-Lanuage-Processing

# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Project 🗣️

## 📖 Overview
This project leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze, process, and derive insights from textual data. By implementing key NLP concepts and machine learning models, it demonstrates the ability to transform raw text into actionable insights.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Preprocess and clean textual data for analysis.
- Apply NLP techniques to extract meaningful features.
- Build models to perform text classification and sentiment analysis.
- Provide visualizations to understand the patterns in the data.

## 🛠️ Key Features

### 🔍 Text Preprocessing
- Tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming, and lemmatization.
- Handled missing data and standardized text formats.

### ✨ Feature Engineering
- Implemented TF-IDF and word embeddings to represent textual data numerically.
- Analyzed word frequencies and n-grams for deeper insights.

### 📈 Predictive Modeling
- Built machine learning models for tasks like:
  - **Text Classification**: Categorizing text into predefined labels.
  - **Sentiment Analysis**: Determining if the sentiment is positive, negative, or neutral.
- Evaluated models using precision, recall, and F1-score.

### 🎨 Visualizations
- Word clouds and bar charts to highlight frequent terms and key insights.
- Sentiment distribution plots for a quick overview of data.
